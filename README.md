# TechNBlack ‚úäüèø

## Description
According to the 2020 IBGE Census, only 29% of workers in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector in Brasil identify as black, while 71% identify as white. These numbers highlight the racial inequality present in the sector and emphasize the urgent need for initiatives that promote inclusion.

The inclusion of black people in the tech industry goes beyond social equity it represents an opportunity for innovation and growth for companies.

Diversity should not only be a moral priority, but also a business strategy. It creates more adaptable work environments and drives technological advancements, allowing different experiences and perspectives to be integrated into the development of more inclusive and effective products and services.

In this context, TechNBlack emerges, the final project from the Programadores do Amanh√£ training program. It is an API designed to manage tech job opportunities specifically for black individuals. The platform was developed as an inclusive solution, facilitating access to job opportunities and promoting greater diversity in the tech sector.
